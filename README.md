# ChatApp  |  Semester Project

## Overview
I have developed a complete chat application using Kotlin and XML in Android native. The app leverages Firebase Realtime Database and kotlin for backend services. It supports one-to-one communication and allows users to customize their profiles, including changing their name and profile picture. The app also includes user authentication with login and sign-up features.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create accounts and log in to the app using their credentials.
- **One-to-One Chat**: Users can engage in one-to-one chat conversations with other users.
- **Profile Customization**: Users can update their profile information, including changing their name and profile picture.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Messages are delivered in real-time using Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Media Storage**: Firebase Firestore is used to store and retrieve profile pictures and other media files.
- **User Presence**: Indicate online/offline status of users.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for new messages and other relevant updates.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Design**: XML
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
